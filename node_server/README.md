# Node.js Boilerplate - Express

Basic boiler plate for Node.js server using Express. As well as directions on how to get started, packages every project should include (and simple rundown on what they do/why you need them), comments explaining what everything does, and how file structure should look.

## App Foundation 

Begin your Node.js application by creating the foundation code in your app.js file. The foundation code should include all the NPM packages you will need to run your project.

Packages Needed include the following: 

Express <br />

Request <br />

### Express 

```
npm install express --save 
```

###  EJS
